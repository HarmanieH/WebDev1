   <p>Alas there are still some ground rules to being a hero</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Do not actually harm our staff!</b></li>
        <p>Every fight is your classical stage fight! If its reported that you have actually harmed our staff you will be marked as a villian and no longer will be allowed to use our services! </p>
        
        <li><b> Listen for a safe word!</b></li>
        <p>Just like you the staff also have a safe word in any case they would not like to continue a fight thats happening. Please listen out for their safe word that wil be provided to you.</p>
        
        <li><b>Dont Surprise people!</b></li>
        <p>If youre going to gift someone else our services make sure to let them know so they wont really be trying to harm our staff out of shock!</p>
