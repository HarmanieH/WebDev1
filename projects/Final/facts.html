            <h3> A rolled up piece of white bread was used to erase graphite before rubber erasers were invented.</h3>
            <h2>In mediaeval times bread was used as absorbent plate. It was called trencher. And after the meal trencher could then be eaten, given to the poor or fed to  dogs.</h2>
            <h4>Combined you would need 9 minutes to harvest enough wheat to make about 70 loaves of bread.</h4>
            <h3>Every year in the UK around 12 billion sandwiches are eaten. That means 380 every second.</h3>
            <h5>The automatic popup bread toaster was patented before the bread slicing machine.</h5>
            <h2>“The greatest forward step in the baking industry since bread was wrapped.” This is believed to be the origin of the far better-known saying we know today, 'the best thing since sliced bread'</h2>
