            <h3>The Brown Panda also known as the Qinling panda </h3>
            <p>The Qinling panda  is a subspecies of the giant panda, discovered in the 1960s but not recognized as a subspecies until 2005. Besides the nominate subspecies, it is the first giant panda subspecies to be recognized. It differs from the more familiar nominate subspecies by its smaller skull and dark brown and light brown (rather than black and white) fur, and its smaller overall size. Its eye spots are under the lower lid, instead of around the eyes. These pandas are an extremely rare subspecies found in the Qinling area. So far, only five-seven have been found.<br><a href="https://www.pandasinternational.org/not-always-black-and-white-the-brown-panda/">Cite1</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinling_panda">Cite2</a></p>

            <h3>The Red Panda</h3>
            <p>The red panda were given the name "panda" first; roughly fifty years before the black and white variety. The origin of “panda” is unknown but could be from the Himalayan language or the French name for the Roman goddess of peace and travellers. The giant panda was not described until 1873 and also named panda because of its similarities to the red panda. Other names for the red panda include cat-bear, bear-cat, lesser panda, fox bear, Himalayan racoon, and firefox (yes, the web browser is named after it) Although red pandas are most closely related to carnivores and they have a carnivore stomach, they mostly eat bamboo and other plants.<br> <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/ecology/animals-ecology/animal-files-curious-case-red-panda/#:~:text=Lithograph%20Louis%20Haghe.-,Red%20pandas%20are%20not%20giant%20pandas,appearance%20and%20bright%20fur%20colour.">Cite</a></p>

            <h3>The Giant panda</h3>
            <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they eat other vegetation, fish, or small animals, but bamboo accounts for 99 percent of their diets. Pandas eat fast, they eat a lot, and they spend about 12 hours a day doing it. Like other bears, pandas can swim! They do not, however, hibernate, as they are unable to store energy over long periods of time<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda">Cite1</a> <a href="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/giant-panda">Cite2</a></p>
